<p>I'd like you to watch <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o">this video</a> about the GitHub Arctic Code Vault. </p>

<p>Thank you for your desire to contribute to this project</p> <br/>

<p>üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <em>"To contribute:

You are required to use the Upper-case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals">Roman Numeral</a> mention for every Issue or Pull Request you make. 
If you don't know what number to use, you may check the previously opened Issue or Pull Request that was made. You may choose to ignore these instructions, if you wish. However for consistency sake, adherence I wish."</em></p>

<p><strong>Concepts</strong>: In programming(objects, arrays, functions, recursions, scopes, e.t.c), technologies, product management, UI/UX, data science, blockchain development, machine learning. Concepts really. e.t.c. Note: Create a section (if it hasn't been created) accordingly using appropriate headers where necessary and paragraph tags and list tags where necessary. Explanations(with provision of code where necessary) should be detailed(include comments where necessary) enough if you atttempt to do so. </p>

<p><strong>People</strong> In tech, from me to you to the next tech person you know making a mark in the tech world. Together with information (about and field) pointing (links, socials) to this person's work(s) (programs created, projects done e.t.c) </p>

<p><strong>Books</strong>: should be split into sections, by language(JavaScript, PHP, Java ·∫π.t.c) and by difficulty(Beginner, Intermediate, Expert). </p>

<p><strong>GitHub</strong>:Everything informative about github goes here, from definitions to tutorials to great tech repos properly sectioned. Note: Any definition given under the Github section should be added to the main dictionary section also in an alphabetical manner. E.g, "git-repo" will be under repo(r) since git is just a prefix and also there could be several definitions of repo in the dictionary stating precisely what it is about(in git/github or otherwise). </p>

Ditto e.t.c. <!-- You can improve this -->
