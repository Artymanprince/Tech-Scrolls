OPENSOURCE. 



The patience and inquisitiveness of a programmer towards growth must never grow weary. 					-Ìtùnúayò Adebiyi(Opensource Advocate).

I dedicate this project to [Ileriayo](https://github.com/Ileriayo) for the constant support on resources in aiding this project and the advice to "ship the damn thing" :) 

I also want to thank [Eddie](https://github.com/eddiejaoude) for the inspiration behind this project and his reassuring support and love towards Opensource.
