## A

- **abstraction**: one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves filtering out ‚Äì essentially, ignoring - the characteristics that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. _See also [decomposition](#d), [algorithm](#a), [pattern recognition](#p)_.

- **accessibility**: the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. 

- **active learning**: a training approach in which the algorithm chooses some of the data it learns from.

- **adaptive design**: the way in which a website is built determines how it appears on different devices. Adaptive design creates a website in several different layouts, each suited for different screen sizes. Depending on what device is being used to access the website, the website will adapt and deliver the appropriate layout. _See also [responsive design](#r)_.

- **agile**: the ability to create and respond to change.
 
- **Agile software development**: software development methodologies that focus on iterative development.

- **algorithm**: one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. An algorithm is a plan, a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. Algorithms are often used as a starting point for creating a computer program, and they are sometimes written as a [flowchart](#f) or in [pseudocode](#p). _See also [pattern recognition](#p), [decomposition](#d), [abstraction](#a)_ 

- **application (software)**: a program or group of programs designed for end users.

- **API (application programming interface)**: what helps different components of software work together so that they all seem to operate as a single software. Such interfaces are very common and help coordinate numerous "moving parts" to make a program or app easy to use.

- **Application Security**: application security is the process of making apps more secure by finding, fixing, and enhancing the security of apps. Application security encompasses measures taken to improve the security of an application often by finding, fixing and preventing security vulnerabilities. Much of this happens during the development phase, but it includes tools and methods to protect apps once they are deployed.

- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application)**: it refers to the idea that web apps are used by a range of people, with differing needs for assistive technology and layout. _See also [Accessibility](#a)_

- **argument**: a value that is passed to a function (as input) when it is called.

- **array**: (in computer science) a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, values, or variables each identified by at least one array index or key. _see [list](#L)_. <br/> Array is an `object` _see [object](#o)_ that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions. 

- **artificial general intelligence**: a non-human mechanism that demonstrates a broad range of problem solving, creativity, and adaptability. For example, a program demonstrating artificial general intelligence could translate text, compose symphonies, and excel at games that have not yet been invented.

- **artificial intelligence**: a non-human program or model that can solve sophisticated tasks.

- **attribute**: information about elements of a component in your website design/build.

- **augmented reality**: a technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.

- **authentication**: the process of verifying identity e.g. a user‚Äôs identity. It might involve validating personal identity documents, verifying the authenticity of a website with a digital certificate, determining the age of an artifact by carbon dating, or ensuring that a product or document is not counterfeit. It is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials.

- **authorization**: the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access policy.

- **comments**: a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters. For example, in Javascript, comments are written using `//` for in-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. 

- **commit (VCS)**: an operation which groups a set of changes behind a name and a number, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository. _See [VCS](#V)_

Content can be selected manually by a person designated as a curator, or it can be gathered through automated programs that track things like upvoting, likes, hashtags, or analysis of a user‚Äôs previous online activity. 

- **control flow**: the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls of an imperative program are executed.

- **data warehouse**: A data warehouse is a large collection of business data used to help an organization make decisions. Data Warehouses are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. It is a system used for reporting and data analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence. The concept of the data warehouse has existed since the 1980s, when it was developed to help transition data from merely powering operations to fueling decision support systems that reveal business intelligence.

- **debugging**: the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.

- **decomposition**: one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand.

HTTP is a set of rules and standards for how hypertext files and all kinds of information are transfered over the web. It's how browsers and servers communicate.. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web(www). Without it the Web wouldn't be what it is today. An HTTP URL starts with http:// and has a number 80 port by default. The HyperText part in the name means that there are documents or files involved. Those can contain text, images, graphics, videos or any other media. In addition, they likely contain links to other documents or files for cross referencing, which you can easily access after clicking the link with a mouse or touchpad or after touching it on your phone screen. The Transfer part in the name means the files can move over the World Wide Web from one networked device to another. The Protocol part means that it consists of a set of computer rules that govern how devices are able to use the Internet.

- **load testing**: Load testing is a type of non-functional testing. A load test is type of software testing which is conducted to understand the behavior of the application under a specific expected load. Load testing is performed to determine a system's behavior under both normal and at peak conditions.

- **log file**: In computing, a log file is a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs, or messages between different users of a communication software. Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are written to a single log file.

- **stack**: In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. Stack is commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example ‚Äì a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. For example, we can place or remove a card or plate from the top of the stack only. Likewise, Stack ADT allows all data operations at one end only.
